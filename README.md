- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Schaasm1 (Steve Schaaf]
- ðŸ‘€ I came here to report a bug/feature in Version 2023-11-15-2237-96d65e85
- of Simon Tatham's Puzzles app on Android. The "feedback" option
- in the app directed me here, but that does not appear to be the
- purpose of this site. Can someone tell me who to contact to describe
- a problem with the new version of Puzzles? I can be reached at
- steve.schaaf@comcast.net
- Thanks
